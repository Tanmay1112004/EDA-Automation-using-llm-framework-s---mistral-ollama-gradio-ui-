The older age might have helped survivors due to better swimming abilities or increased chances of being prioritized for lifeboats.\n",

            "The Titanic dataset reveals that a higher proportion of women survived the disaster compared to men (68% vs 31.7%, respectively). A chi-square test of independence (p-value < 0.05) confirms this difference is statistically significant, indicating that gender played a role in survival rates. Women were more likely to be traveling in third class and less likely to be on the deck when the ship struck the iceberg, which might have contributed to their higher survival rate.\n",

A chi-square test of independence (p-value < 0.05) indicates that this difference is statistically significant, suggesting that class was an important factor affecting survival. First-class passengers had access to more lifeboats and might have been prioritized when filling them due to their higher fare.\n",

            "4. Number of siblings/spouses aboard:\n",
            "There does not seem to be a clear relationship between the number of siblings or spouses on board and the likelihood of survival, as there is no statistically significant difference in survival rates among passengers with different family sizes.\n",
            "\n",
            "In conclusion, the Titanic disaster was influenced by multiple factors affecting survival, including age, gender, class, and family size. Older passengers and women were more likely to survive, while those traveling in first class had a higher chance of surviving compared to second- or third-class passengers. The number of siblings/spouses aboard did not significantly impact the chances of survival. Understanding these factors can help us analyze historical disasters and develop more effective disaster response strategies in the future.\n"
